# WebDrive
This is a project I've been working on every once and a while. Basically its my version of Google Drive.

Fatures:
 - ALlows users to make their own cloud service from their computer/ or hosting service
 - Stores files
 - Easy to use
 
How To:
 - Download the repo as a zip then unzip and place into your server.
 - Change the folder "files" permission level 777.
 
Troubleshooting:
 - Make sure that the folder "files" has the perm level 777.
 - Make sure your ip points to the index file.
